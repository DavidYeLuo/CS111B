# CS111B
First programming class(Programming Fundamental) in City College of San Francisco in Fall of 2016.

About the assignments:
The assignment wasn't very challenging in the year so I spent time some time making the program more userfriendly.
The main goal for this year was learning to document and write understandable code.

In case if you're not familiar with Java.
First we need to know which the driver class is. It is the file with the same name as the folder.
To make sure that it is a driver class, the file should have the main(String[] args) method.
Then we will compile and run the file.

1) To run the program you need to have Java installed.
2) Run Command Prompt(CMD) in your computer.
3) Navigate the CMD using "dir" and "cd" command to find the file location where java files are located.
4) To complile the class, use the command "javac <javafilename>.java" which will create a <javafilename>.class file.
5) To run the class, to run the program using the command "java <javafilename>" (without .java)
